    "Python has some really great ways to visualize out data. One of the standards is a library called `matplotlib`. Inside `matplotlib` is a collection of plotting tools called `pyplot` that are used all the time. Throughout the course we are going to make some great plots with `matplotlib`.\n",

    "1. click the 'terminal' tile to open a terminal\n",

    "\n",
    "We are going to import a lot of helper tools (see comic below). We are lazy and would like to not type 'numpy' and 'matplotlib' out all the time in our code. fortunately we can use a shortcut to give nicknames to the libaries. To import a librbary with a nickname we do it with the `as` keyword, like this:\n",

The first denotes how many total rows of subplots there are, the second parameter refers to the total number of subplot columns, and the final parameter denotes which subplot your variable is referencing (left-to-right, top-to-bottom). Each subplot is stored in a different variable `(axes1, axes2, axes3)`. Once a subplot is created, the axes can be labeled using the `set_xlabel()` command (or `set_ylabel()`).
